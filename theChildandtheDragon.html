                    <hr />

                    <p>
                        There once was a fierce and terrible dragon that lived
                        in a cave at the top of a mountain in Dagoland. He was
                        constantly confronted by knights who wanted to slay him
                        for he was the last of his kind and whoever defeated him
                        would gain immense glory and fame across the land. He
                        fought and fought and defeated every last one of them,
                        for this reason nobody dared climb the mountain.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        One day a new family arrived in Dagoland to whom nobody
                        told about the dragon. It was a big and happy family and
                        the youngest son was the kindest and happiest, his name
                        was Dante. One day his mother asked him to go out and
                        look or some medicinal herbs. Dante climbed the mountain
                        unknowing of the danger and began his task.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Reaching the top of the mountain he saw a cave with a
                        very big and curious entrance. His curiosity got the
                        better of him and so he went inside. As soon as he
                        entered the dragon became aware and hid in a dark corner
                        of the cave.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        <q><em>Stop</em></q
                        ><br />
                        roared the dragon,<br />
                        <q
                            ><em
                                >If you have come here to challenge me, let me
                                rest.</em
                            ></q
                        >
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The child astonished stood his ground and said: <br /><q
                            ><em
                                >I have come to challenge no one; I am looking
                                for medicinal herbs.</em
                            ></q
                        >
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The dragon relaxed and lay down as he said: <br /><q
                            ><em
                                >Well, then leave my cave, there are no herbs
                                here.</em
                            ></q
                        >
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        <q><em>But who am I talking to?</em></q
                        ><br />
                        asked Dante
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        <q><em>You have not heard of me?</em></q
                        ><br />
                        said the dragon <br />
                        <q
                            ><em
                                >I am the dragon that lives at the top of this
                                mountain. My name is Garrow and I am the last of
